# vSphere Builder

The vSphere Packer builder is able to create vSphere virtual machines for use
with any VMware product.

Packer actually comes with two builders able to create vSphere machines,
depending on the strategy you want to use to build the image. Packer supports
the following vSphere builders:

- [vsphere-iso](/docs/builders/vsphere-iso) - This builder starts from an
  ISO file and utilizes the vSphere API to build on a remote esx instance.
  This allows you to build vms even if you do not have SSH access to your vSphere cluster.

- [vsphere-clone](/docs/builders/vsphere-clone) - This builder clones a
  vm from an existing template, then modifies it and saves it as a new
  template. It uses the vSphere API to build on a remote esx instance.
  This allows you to build vms even if you do not have SSH access to your vSphere cluster.
