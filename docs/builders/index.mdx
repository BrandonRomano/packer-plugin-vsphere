# vSphere Builder

The vSphere Packer builder is able to create vSphere virtual machines for use
with any VMware product.

This Packer plugin includes three builders to create vSphere machines,
depending on the strategy you want to use to build the image:

- [vsphere-iso](/packer/plugins/builders/vsphere/vsphere-iso) - This builder starts from an
  ISO file and utilizes the vSphere API to build on a remote esx instance.
  This allows you to build vms even if you do not have SSH access to your vSphere cluster.

- [vsphere-clone](/packer/plugins/builders/vsphere/vsphere-clone) - This builder clones a
  vm from an existing template, then modifies it and saves it as a new
  template. It uses the vSphere API to build on a remote esx instance.
  This allows you to build vms even if you do not have SSH access to your vSphere cluster.

- [vsphere-supervisor](/packer/plugins/builders/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor) - This builder deploys a
  vm to a vSphere Supervisor cluster, using the VM-Service API. This allows you to build
  vms without spec yaml files and configure them after using the Packer provisioners.

## How to use this plugin

From Packer v1.7.0, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration to install this plugin.
Then, run [`packer init`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/commands/init).

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    vsphere = {
      version = ">= 1.1.1"
      source = "github.com/hashicorp/vsphere"
    }
  }
}
```
